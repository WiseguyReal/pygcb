# Python Review

## Introduction

This tutorial will give us some practice using Python code so that we can review and remember some of the skills we will need for this course.

## Lists and Loops

In the file `overlappying.py` there is some starter code. It contains 2 lists; your goal is to identify the overlapping values in the lists. 

```bash
edit lesson02/overlapping.py
```

You'll need to use loops to check the values in one list against the other. Once you've edited the code, you can run it with the following command.

```bash
python lesson02/overlapping.py
```

## Strings

In the file `word_counter.py` there is some starter code. This code identifies a word that you'll be looking for; there's also a string to search for that word. Your goal is to write code that

```bash
edit lesson02/word_counter.py
```

There are several ways to solve this problem, but you'll probably need to use slices, if statements, and loops to count these values. When you're ready, you can run the code with the following command.

```bash
python lesson02/word_counter.py
```

## Functions

For this problem, we'll write a function to compute a termial. A termial of any integer is the sum of all of the integers from 1 to that integer.

For example, the termial of 1 is 1, the termial of 2 is 3 (2 + 1), the termial of 3 is 6 (3 + 2 + 1), the termial of 4 is 10 (4 + 3 + 2 + 1), and so on.

Complete the code in `termial.py`.

```bash
edit lesson02/termial.py
```

When you're ready, you can test it using the following command.

```bash
python lesson02/termial.py
```

Congratulations and thanks for sticking with it so far! If you want to run these tutorials again, you can do this with the `teachme` command - just enter `teachme the-name-of-the-file.md` to start them again.
