# Python Review

## Introduction

This tutorial will give us some practice using Python code so that we can review and remember some of the skills we will need for this course.

## Lists and Loops

In the file `overlappying.py` there is some starter code. It contains 2 lists; your goal is to identify the overlapping values in the lists. 

```bash
edit lesson02/overlapping.py
```

You'll need to use loops to check the values in one list against the other.
